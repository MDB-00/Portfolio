      <p>
        I am currently a student at Base Camp Coding Academy where I am learning
        various technical and project management skills needed to make my
        professional debut in the tech industry. I first dabbled with tech in
        2018 when I built my PC and fell in love so much so that out of nowhere
        I decided that my sister must also need a PC, so I built hers as well.
      </p>

        Afterwards, I became interested in game development and in 2022 I came
        across a C# course and learned enough to make a simple 2D game. Working
        with teams and creating projects at BCCA reaffirmed my interested in
        having a career in the tech industry.
